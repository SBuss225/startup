# 1/27 - Startup Specs: The Escape Room

I have a cool idea for a simple web game that users could play together on any browser. Escape rooms are becoming more and more popular as group activities, but going to escape rooms in person can be expensive and inconvenient, especially for people who live far away from each other or from escape room facilities. My suggestion is a simple online escape room where users follow clues and solve puzzles in order to escape from a locked room before time runs out. High scores will be posted along with team names on a leaderboard to encourage friendly competition, and the escape room will provide an engaging yet simple puzzle activity for friends, families, and strangers alike to play together. 

Key Features
-Ability to create and login with a team username
-Several display screens for each side of the room
-Interactable puzzles
-Leaderboard with fastest completion speeds 
-Personal best information persistently stored
